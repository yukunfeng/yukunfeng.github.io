I'm a master student at <a href="http://lr-www.pi.titech.ac.jp/wp/">Okumura-Takamura Lab</a> at
Tokyo Institute of Technology.  My current research topics are neural language model (particularly
character-aware language model) and word
representation learning. My email is x@gmail.com  where x is yukunfg
