        I'm a master student working with Prof. <a href="http://www.lr.pi.titech.ac.jp/~takamura/">Hiroya Takamura</a> at Tokyo Institute of Techonology.
        Before that I was a full-time R & D engieer in China. I'm interested in natural language processing
        and machine learning. In my master study, I will focus on text summarization and generation. I am
        also interested in lexical semantics and have some industrial experiences on language modeling.

<h1 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h1>
- I like watching Japanese animation.
- I also enjoy playing table tennis.
- I ever wrote some Chinese [blogs](https://blog.csdn.net/a635661820) to help myself learn and memorize some machine learning methods. And now it has been visited more than 160 thousand times. But now I haven't maintained it for a long time.
